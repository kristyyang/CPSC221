2. 

a) with load factor around 7/10, Linear Hash is as good as quadratic, according to the result value. when load factor around 9/10 the quadratic appears better behaviour.

b) No, we cannot make it as good as quadratic function. Because double hash function has hash2 function, everytime when we call double hashing funtion, we add numbers of hash2 funtion.

However, quadratic function we only add i^2 in the initial hashing funtion.

c) load factor is 9/10, d is greater than l and q.

d) I would choose double hash function, because it will succeed when insert number is prime and load factor < 1, and does not have to be big gain as linear and quadratic

Q4.
Recurrence relation in math notation:

c(n) = Î£_(m=1)^(n) (n-1 + c(m -1) + c(n-m)) / n

Q5.

a) Average case: O(nlogn)

b) Worest case : O(n^2)>= (n-1)+(n-2)+(n-3).....+1, because it would requrire to choose the min/max element
for each the pivot, since the pivot was chosen randomly it would be hard to choose extreme value to be chosen chonsistenly.



No it is not in-place sort, we are using extra memory for accessing stack frames from of the recursive calls.

Not stable, when we call swap it did not maintain and preserve the order.
